Let's play 2048 on Praat!

## Abstract
Praat is great software for sound analysis and control.

But do you know we can also play games on it?

1. Open main.praat on Praat

2. Run & Enjoy 2048!

## Control
[right], d: right

[left], a: left

[up], w: up

[down], s: down

q: quit to play

Praat 6.0.30+

## Note
This is the joke app.

In this script, there are some tricks to "look like" OOP

but I don't recommend to use these for proper analysis tools.
